           <h2>📰 1. Fake News Prediction</h2> 

<b>Goal:</b>
To detect whether a given news article is real or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

<b> Tech Stack:</b>
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLP libraries (like NLTK or spaCy), Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes.

<b>Key Features & Workflow:</b>
Dataset (e.g., from Kaggle) containing news titles and text.

Text preprocessing — removing stopwords, punctuation, stemming.

Converting text into numerical form using TF-IDF Vectorizer.

Applying machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, or Naive Bayes).

Evaluating accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

<b>How to Explain:</b>
“I built a Fake News Prediction model that classifies news articles as real or fake using NLP and machine learning. I used TF-IDF to vectorize text data and applied Logistic Regression for classification, achieving around 90% accuracy.”

<h2>🧮 2. Sorting Visualizer</h2>
<b>Goal:</b>
To visualize how different sorting algorithms work step-by-step.

<b>Tech Stack:</b>
HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

<b>Key Features:</b>

Algorithms — Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.

Bars represent array elements; height corresponds to values.

Animations show comparisons and swaps in real-time.

Adjustable speed and array size options.

How to Explain:

“I built an interactive Sorting Visualizer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that animates sorting algorithms in real-time. It helped me deeply understand sorting logic and algorithm time complexity.”

<h2>🗺️ 3. Shortest Path in a Graph</h2>
<b>Goal:</b>
To find the shortest route between nodes in a graph.

<b>Tech Stack:</b>
C++ or Python (using Dijkstra’s / BFS / DFS algorithm), possibly with a GUI (HTML + JS or C++ graphics library).

<b>Key Features:</b>

Graph input (nodes and edges with weights).

Implementation of Dijkstra’s or BFS algorithm.

Visualization of nodes and shortest path highlight.

Output showing the shortest distance and path sequence.

How to Explain:

“This project implements Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes. It takes weighted graph input and outputs the minimum distance and the path sequence.”

<h2>📂 4. Resume Uploader</h2>
<b>Goal:</b>
To upload and manage resumes in a simple web interface — used for placement or HR systems.

<b>Tech Stack:</b>
HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend) + PHP/MySQL (Backend).

Key Features:

Users can upload resumes in PDF/DOC format.

Data stored securely in MySQL database.

Admin dashboard to view, search, and download resumes.

Basic authentication (login/register).

How to Explain:

“I developed a Resume Uploader web app using PHP and MySQL that allows users to upload and manage resumes. Admins can review, download, and manage submissions via a dashboard.”

<h2>📚 5. Digital Library Management System
</h2>
<b>📚 5. Digital Library Management System
</b>
To manage books, users, and borrowing records for a library.

<b>Tech Stack:
</b>
PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Key Features:

Separate Admin and Student logins.

Admin: add, update, delete books; manage students and issue/return records.

Student: search books, view borrowed items, and request new books.

Database stores all book and user data.

Responsive front-end interface.

How to Explain:

“This is a full-fledged web-based Library Management System built with PHP and MySQL. It includes separate dashboards for admins and students with features for book management, user authentication, and transaction tracking.”

<h2>🐶 6. Dog vs. Cat Image Classification (Research Paper Project)</h2>

<b>Goal:</b>
To classify images as dog or cat using deep learning.

Tech Stack:
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks).

Key Features:

Image dataset preprocessing (resizing, normalization).

CNN model built and trained on labeled images.

Achieved good accuracy on validation set.

Output: “Dog” or “Cat” prediction for input image.

How to Explain:

“For my research project, I implemented a CNN-based image classifier to distinguish between dog and cat images using TensorFlow and Keras. The model was trained on thousands of labeled images and achieved strong accuracy.”
